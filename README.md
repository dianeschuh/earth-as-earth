# earth-as-earth
real time electronics patch for the mixed piece "earth as earth"

Programme notes:
« The piece “Earth as earth,” composed by Diane Schuh as part of the SOIL project, is an exploration of musical form based on this subterranean listening. 
Written for the Longleash trio, this mixed-music apparatus with real-time electronics does not seek to represent the soil, but to explore its own dynamics, 
playing on discontinuity, the cohabitation of flows, and the emergence of unstable motifs, by means of a singular approach to sonic space. Conceived as a 
sensory immersion in the temporalities of the soil, the piece weaves together captured sounds and instrumental gestures, and attempts to open a listening space 
shared between humans and living milieus. »
